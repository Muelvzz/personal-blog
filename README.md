# Hey There! I've changed this project altogether

The reason of me doing that was because I didn't like how that project all came-out. Sure I was able to make some features working but I wasn't able to truly understand what I was doing. Majority of what I was doing at those times especially the python codes when it comes to routing the web was me depending on the A.I too much.

I want to start fresh while still, that's why I am going to stick to the old school method which is to watch a tutorial on YouTube. Though I will not be passive though, I will try to code as the video progresses - make codes on my own when the instructor is syaing something like they should add a feature or whatever.
